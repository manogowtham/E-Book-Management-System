E-BOOK MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM

1.OBJECTIVE:

 The main objective of the document is to illustrate the
Requirements of project E-Book Management system. The document gives the
detailed description of both functional and non-functional requirements. It will also
explain about the features of the system interface of the system. What the system
will do, the constraint under which it must operate and how the system will react to
external stimuli. The document is developed after a number of consultations with
team members and specification of the given project.

2.SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:

The software provide the visitor, customer and administrator a easy and efficient way
to buy and manage books in online.
Software provides following facilities to customer:
 Facilitates easy shopping online.
 Provides information about the products in categories.
 Provides e-mail facility for future correspondence.
 Provides Backup facility.
 Software provides the following facilities to the merchant.
 Manages the Transportation of hard copy of Book.
 Look after the payment method.

3.PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This software is totally self contained and works relatively an efficient on the package
relates to the software. It provides simple database rather than complex one for high
requirement and it provides a good and easy graphical user interface to both new
and naïve as well as experienced user of the computer.

4.REQUIREMENTS:

(a).FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

 Register - Enter details in application form.
 Login - Enter Username and Password.
 Search - Search book by attribute.
 Buy - Download softcopies and order for hard copy.
 Payment - Pay for books in different method.
 Update - Update User details

(b).NON- FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

 Bookmark - Bookmark the Website.
 Categories - Book categories in Website.
 Most Downloaded - Highest purchased book.
 Offers - Offer given by merchant.
 Carting - Mark and select multiple books.

5. MODULE DISCRIPTION:

In this project we have defined different modules to enable the E-Book Management
in successful manner.

i. REGISTER:

The register module contains the application form or registration form which contains
following details.
 Name, Address, Contact number, E-mail id, Password etc.

ii. LOGIN:

The Login module contain the form which contain membership name and member
password.
It includes Username and Password

iii. SEARCH BOOK:

The search book module contain list of books,from this list we search for the book
which we need.This also containes another field called as categories where can
select the category of the book.

iv. DOWNLOAD:

The download module contains the downloading option for where purpose where we
can download,whatever Ebook we search and found.

v. PAYMENT:

After the book is searched and found. Then the user is going to download the book.
Before the downloading the books needs payment for that book. So user has to
select the type of transaction wheather credit card (or) debit card (or) cash (or)
cheque (or) DD.

vi. SALES RECORD:

The website admin has to maintain the sales record where the record should be in
updated, where how many books is salesed. How much amount credited and names
of user who downloaded that book and how much they paid for dowloading the book.

vii. UPDATE:

The update module should maintained by the website administrator. The admin
should update each and every process like.
  Number of user registered
  Registered user viewing.
  Downlaoding by user.
  Payment affered by user.
UML USECASE DIAGRAM:
Uml provides use case diagram natation to iilustrate the names of use case and
author relationship between them. Use case diagram and case relationship are
secondary in use case work usecase text document

UML ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:

A Uml activity diagram shows sequential and parallel activites in a process,work
flows,data flows and compiler algorithm
ACTIVITY DIAGRAM
UML CLASS DIAGRAM:
The Uml class diagram is to illutrates class interfaces ans their actions.They are
used for ststic object modeling, we have already introduced and used their uml
diagram while domain modeling.
CLASS DIAGRAM

UML SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:

A sequence diagram illustrate akind of format in which each object interact via
message. It is generalize between two or more specialized diagram.
SEQUENCE DIAGRAM

UML COLLABRATION DIAGRAM:

Communicaton diagram illustrate that object interact on a graph or network format in
which object can be placed where an thw diagram. In collabration diagram the object
can be placed in anywhere on the daigram. The collabration comes from sequence
diagram.
COLLABRATION DIAGRAM

UML STATE CHART DIAGRAM:

A Uml state machine represents the interaction events and states of an object and
behaviour of an object in reaction to an event.. Transaction shown as allows labelled
with their event. It is included with initial psedo state and fins end state.

UML COMPONENT DIAGRAM:

Components are slightly fuzzy concept in this Uml,because both class and
components can be used to model the something.

UML DEPLOYEMENT DIAGRAM:

Deployement diagram shows the assignment of concrete software artifact to
computational nodes. It shows the deployement of software elements to the physical
elements. Deployement diagram are useful to communicate or deployement
architecture.

CONCLUSION:

Thus the project for E-BOOK MANAGEMENT has been successfully executed and
codes are generated.
